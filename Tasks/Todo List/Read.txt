For your next task, how about practicing by building a simple interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Here's a basic idea to get you started:

Task: Build a To-Do List Application
Description:
Create a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

Requirements:

Display an input field and a button for adding tasks.
When the user enters a task and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.
Each task should have a checkbox that users can click to mark the task as completed.
Include a delete button for each task that allows users to remove tasks from the list.
Style your application using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Optional Enhancements:

Add validation to prevent users from adding empty tasks.
Implement local storage to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed.
Allow users to edit tasks directly in the list.
Implement sorting or filtering options for the tasks.
Resources:

Use HTML for structuring your application.
Apply CSS for styling and layout.
Use JavaScript for implementing the functionality, such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
This project will allow you to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while creating a useful and interactive application. Feel free to customize the features and design according to your preferences! Once you've completed the task, you can showcase your work or share it with others to gather feedback. If you encounter any challenges along the way, don't hesitate to ask for help or search for resources online. Happy coding!
